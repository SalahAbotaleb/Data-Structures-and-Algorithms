/***
 * HashTable goal: We want to perform search, insert and delete in O(1)
 * First idea:
 * Direct access table: using the key directly access an entry in the array/table
 * but what if the universe of keys is very large, a huge table will result!!!
 * Second idea:
 * Compress the universe of keys since the actual keys count are not equal to the universe count
 * Imagine an ID: 12345678911 this doesn't mean that there exists 12 Billion users
 * so we can compress this number to a smaller number that can correspond to an entry in
 * a table. The hashing reduces the needed table size.
 * Problem now what if two keys are hashed and results the same hash value?
 * A collision resolution is required.
 * Two methods:
 * - Chaining
 * - Open addressing
 * The goal of hash function is to minimize the collisions as much as possible
 * Example of hash functions:
 * - k mod m, where m has to be a prime why?
 *   because prime numbers results in distributed remainders in a good way that can reduce collisions
 * - multiplication method
 * Chaining Collision resolution:
 * The idea is to hash a key and insert the value in the entry corresponding to the key
 * what if collision:
 * Chain, which means chain the nodes in a linked list so that for each entry there exists
 * a linked list for the nodes.
 *
 * The disadvantage of this method is that if the hash function has bad distribution
 * this may result in having a single or two entries having long chain of linked list
 * which can cause costly operations of order O(n) which contradicts with the main goal
 * of hash table.
 *
 * important term "Load factor"
 * the load factor shows the number of nodes on average in an entry linked list.
 * load factor alpha = n/m where n is number of nodes and m is the table size.
 * so that the complexity of hash table operations become O(1 + alpha)
 *
 * Open addressing collision resolution:
 * No linked lists.
 * Just hash a key and insert in the corresponding entry
 * if entry is busy
 * hash again using example (iteration*key) mod m
 * and probe (test) again the other location.
 * If empty ok.
 *
 * For search:
 * Perform like insert until you find the entry with the intended key.
 * If you reached Null/Nil this means that the key is not found XD.
 *
 * For delete:
 * remove the entry and mark with a special flag to avoid
 * "If we delete an element while there are elements inserted after it, we
 *  canâ€™t search after deletion because the element is marked as nil"
 *
 * Open addressing can have a size for the entry.
 * Which means that the entry is now a bucket that has multiple entries
 * which can help to reduce collision resolution need and improve performance.
